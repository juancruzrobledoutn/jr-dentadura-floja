    ==========================================
    These are COMPILE-TIME defaults used when settings are not available.
    At RUNTIME, the ConnectionManager and other components read from
    `shared.settings.settings` which can override these values via
    environment variables. The settings take precedence.

    - MAX_TRACKED_CONNECTIONS -> derived from settings.ws_max_total_connections

    # ==========================================================================
    # Timeout Constants
    # ==========================================================================

    # WS_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT: 90 seconds
    # Rationale: Must be longer than heartbeat interval (30s) to avoid false
    # positives. At 3x the heartbeat interval, allows for network jitter and
    # client delays while still detecting truly dead connections.
    WS_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT: Final[float] = 90.0

    # JWT_REVALIDATION_INTERVAL: 5 minutes (300 seconds)
    # Rationale: Balances security vs performance. Shorter intervals catch
    # revoked tokens faster but add Redis overhead. 5 minutes means a revoked
    # token has max 5 min window of use for existing connections.
    JWT_REVALIDATION_INTERVAL: Final[float] = 300.0

    # SEC-HIGH-01 FIX: TABLE_TOKEN_REVALIDATION_INTERVAL: 30 minutes (1800 seconds)
    # Rationale: Table tokens represent physical presence at a table but can
    # expire during long dining sessions (2+ hours). Checking every 30 minutes
    # balances security (token expiration handled) with minimal overhead.
    # This interval should be less than the token's TTL (typically 4 hours).
    TABLE_TOKEN_REVALIDATION_INTERVAL: Final[float] = 1800.0

    # DB_LOOKUP_TIMEOUT: 2 seconds
    # Rationale: Sector assignment lookups should be fast (<100ms typical).
    # 2 seconds is generous to handle slow DB but prevents blocking the
    # event loop if DB is unresponsive. After timeout, waiter receives
    # all branch events as fallback.
    DB_LOOKUP_TIMEOUT: Final[float] = 2.0

    # WS_ACCEPT_TIMEOUT: 5 seconds
    # Rationale: WebSocket handshake should complete within TCP timeout.
    # 5 seconds handles slow networks while rejecting stuck connections.
    WS_ACCEPT_TIMEOUT: Final[float] = 5.0

    # ==========================================================================
    # Lock Management Constants
    # ==========================================================================

    # MAX_CACHED_LOCKS: 500
    # Rationale: Typical deployment has 10-50 branches. 500 allows for 10x
    # growth while limiting memory usage. Each lock is ~200 bytes, so 500
    # locks use ~100KB - negligible memory footprint.
    MAX_CACHED_LOCKS: Final[int] = 500

    # LOCK_CLEANUP_THRESHOLD: 400 (80% of MAX_CACHED_LOCKS)
    # Rationale: Start cleanup before hitting the limit to avoid blocking.
    # 80% threshold provides buffer for burst of new branches while
    # triggering proactive cleanup.
    LOCK_CLEANUP_THRESHOLD: Final[int] = 400

    # LOCK_CLEANUP_HYSTERESIS_RATIO: 0.8 (80%)
    # Rationale: When cleanup runs, reduce lock count to 80% of threshold.
    # This hysteresis prevents "cleanup thrashing" where we repeatedly
    # hit threshold, clean 1 lock, hit threshold again. With 0.8 ratio:
    # - At 400 locks (threshold), cleanup triggers
    # - Reduces to 320 locks (80% of 400), leaving 80-lock buffer
    # - Next cleanup won't trigger until 400 again
    # This pattern is common in cache eviction (see Redis maxmemory-samples).
    LOCK_CLEANUP_HYSTERESIS_RATIO: Final[float] = 0.8

    # ==========================================================================
    # Rate Limiter Constants
    # ==========================================================================

    # MAX_TRACKED_CONNECTIONS: 2000
    # Rationale: With MAX_TOTAL_CONNECTIONS=1000, this allows 2x headroom
    # for connections being cleaned up or in transition states. Prevents
    # memory leak from tracking already-disconnected connections.
    MAX_TRACKED_CONNECTIONS: Final[int] = 2000

    # EVICTION_PERCENTAGE: 10%
    # Rationale: When rate limiter is at capacity, remove 10% oldest entries.
    # Small enough to avoid performance spike, large enough to create
    # breathing room for new connections.
    EVICTION_PERCENTAGE: Final[int] = 10

    # ==========================================================================
    # Event Queue Constants
    # ==========================================================================

    # DROP_LOG_INTERVAL: 100
    # Rationale: Log every 100th dropped event to avoid log spam during
    # overload while still providing visibility. At 1000 events/sec max,
    # this logs at most 10 times/sec during sustained overload.
    DROP_LOG_INTERVAL: Final[int] = 100

    # MAX_UNKNOWN_FIELDS: 10
    # LOW-WS-04 FIX: Documented rationale more explicitly
    # Rationale: Events typically have 1-5 extra fields for forward compatibility.
    # More than 10 unknown fields strongly indicates:
    # - Malformed event from buggy publisher
    # - Version mismatch between services
    # - Potential injection attack (crafted payload)
    # This threshold balances forward compatibility with security.
    # Adjust to 15 if legitimate events routinely have more fields.
    MAX_UNKNOWN_FIELDS: Final[int] = 10

    # ==========================================================================
    # Sector Validation Constants (MED-01 FIX)
    # ==========================================================================

    # MAX_SECTORS_PER_WAITER: 10
    # Rationale: Typical restaurant has 2-5 sectors per branch. A waiter
    # assigned to more than 10 sectors is suspicious and may indicate
    # misconfiguration or attack. This is a warning threshold, not hard limit.
    MAX_SECTORS_PER_WAITER: Final[int] = 10

    # ==========================================================================
    # Unknown Event Types Tracking
    # ==========================================================================

    # MAX_UNKNOWN_EVENT_TYPES: 100
    # Rationale: Prevents unbounded memory growth if attacker sends random
    # event types. 100 unique types is generous for forward compatibility
    # while limiting memory to ~10KB worst case.
    # DEF-02 FIX: Added limit to _unknown_event_types_seen set.
    MAX_UNKNOWN_EVENT_TYPES: Final[int] = 100

    # ==========================================================================
    # Circuit Breaker Constants
    # ==========================================================================

    # CIRCUIT_FAILURE_THRESHOLD: 5
    # Rationale: 5 consecutive failures before opening circuit. Handles
    # transient errors while quickly detecting sustained failures.
    CIRCUIT_FAILURE_THRESHOLD: Final[int] = 5

    # CIRCUIT_RECOVERY_TIMEOUT: 30 seconds
    # Rationale: Time in OPEN state before attempting recovery. 30 seconds
    # allows dependent services time to recover without leaving circuit
    # open too long.
    CIRCUIT_RECOVERY_TIMEOUT: Final[float] = 30.0

    # CIRCUIT_HALF_OPEN_MAX_CALLS: 3
    # Rationale: Number of test calls allowed in HALF_OPEN state. 3 calls
    # confirm recovery without overwhelming a still-recovering service.
    CIRCUIT_HALF_OPEN_MAX_CALLS: Final[int] = 3

    # ==========================================================================
    # Heartbeat Constants
    # ==========================================================================

    # HEARTBEAT_CLEANUP_INTERVAL: 30 seconds
    # Rationale: Check for stale connections every 30 seconds. Matches
    # typical client ping interval. More frequent checks waste CPU,
    # less frequent delays dead connection cleanup.
    HEARTBEAT_CLEANUP_INTERVAL: Final[float] = 30.0

    # LOCK_CLEANUP_CYCLE: 5 (every 5 heartbeat cycles = 2.5 minutes)
    # Rationale: Lock cleanup is less urgent than connection cleanup.
    # Running every 2.5 minutes balances memory reclamation with CPU usage.
    LOCK_CLEANUP_CYCLE: Final[int] = 5

    # ==========================================================================
    # HIGH-NEW-01 FIX: Broadcast Rate Limiting
    # ==========================================================================

    # MAX_BROADCASTS_PER_SECOND: 10
    # Rationale: Global broadcasts are expensive (send to ALL connections).
    # Limit to 10/sec to prevent DoS via broadcast spam. Normal operation
    # uses targeted sends (to branch/sector/session), not global broadcasts.
    MAX_BROADCASTS_PER_SECOND: Final[int] = 10

    # ==========================================================================
    # HIGH-NEW-02 FIX: Dead Connections Limit
    # ==========================================================================

    # MAX_DEAD_CONNECTIONS: 500
    # Rationale: Limit size of _dead_connections set to prevent unbounded
    # memory growth. When limit is reached, oldest entries are cleaned up
    # immediately instead of waiting for periodic cleanup.
    MAX_DEAD_CONNECTIONS: Final[int] = 500
