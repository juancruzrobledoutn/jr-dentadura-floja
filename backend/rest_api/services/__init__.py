"""
Services module for business logic.

CLEAN ARCHITECTURE:
- domain/: Application services (business logic) - USE THESE
- crud/: Repository pattern, soft delete, audit
- payments/: Payment processing and external integrations
- catalog/: Product catalog and content management
- rag/: AI chatbot and retrieval-augmented generation
- events/: Real-time event publishing
- permissions/: Strategy pattern for role-based access control

Usage:
    # PREFERRED: Use domain services (Clean Architecture)
    from rest_api.services.domain import CategoryService
    service = CategoryService(db)
    categories = service.list_by_branch(tenant_id, branch_id)
